# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Gonzalo Allendes, an aspiring Software Engineer interested in web applications,
data science, machine learning, and all branches of computer science.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Most of my projects are in private repositories. I am awaiting clearance to publicly release a Data Science project where I utilized Machine Learning algorithms to predict Environmental Performance Index scores based on renewable energy data.
- âš¡ For now, my public GitHub profile shows a hackathon contribution.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning ```data science``` with ```python```, ```vue.js```, ```node.js```, ```database management```, ```web applications```, ```aws```, and ```arduino``` with a ```microchip``` board!
